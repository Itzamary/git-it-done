# Git-It-Done

## Description
This is a project where a user can search for GitHub accounts by user-name or front end languages. Once an account is found we are shown the repositories in that account and if it has any open issues. If you click on a repository than we are taken to a page with a list of those issues. We are able to do this by using the Fetch API in the client side and requesting data from the GitHub server side API.
